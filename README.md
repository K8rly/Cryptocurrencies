# Cryptocurrencies

This project aims to show what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped into a classification system. Reporting these results will help the company Accountability Accounting determine whether they can and should offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. 

The data used is not ideal and needs to be processed to fit machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what is needed, unsupervised learning is the best option. Cryptocurrencies are grouped using a clustering algorithm and data visualizations will highlight results to share with the board at Accountability Accounting so they can make an investment decision.
